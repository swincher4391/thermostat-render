and to assure continuous operation during any period of interruption of gas deliveries.
6.Alternative Fuel Responsive Flex Provision
Notwithstanding any other provision of this tariff, the Company may, periodically, flex the otherwise
applicable rate on a customer specific basis if, a customer presents sufficient reliable and persuasive
information to satisfactorily prove to the Company that alternative fuel, usable by the customer’s facility,
is readily available, in both advantageous price and adequate quantity, to completely or materially displace
the gas service that would otherwise be facilitated by this tariff. The customer shall submit the appropriate
information by affidavit on a form on file with the Commission and provided by the Company. The
Company may require additional information to evaluate the merit of the flex request.
Pursuant to this Section, the Company may flex the otherwise applicable transportation rate to allow the
delivered cost of gas to approximate the customer’s total cost, including handling and storage charges, of
available alternative fuel. The minimum flexed rate shall be the non-commodity component of the
customer’s otherwise applicable rate.
The Company will not flex for volumes which, if delivered, would exceed either (1) the current operable
alternative fuel fired capability of the customer’s facilities, or (2) the energy equivalent of the quantity of
alternative fuel available to the customer, whichever is less. The Company reserves the right to confirm,
to its satisfaction, the customer’s alternative fuel capability and the reasonableness of the represented price
and quantity of available alternative fuel.

current Refund Factor reflects refunds received from suppliers during the reporting period. The
Refund Factor will be determined by dividing the refunds received plus estimated interest1, by the
annual sales used in the quarterly filing less transported volumes. After a refund factor has
remained in effect for twelve months, the difference in the amount received and the amount
refunded plus the accrued interest1 will be rolled into the next refund calculation. The refund
account will be operated independently of the CF and only added as a component to the GCA in
order to obtain a net GCA. In the event of any large or unusual refunds, the Company may apply
to the Commission for the right to depart from the refund procedure herein set forth.

TAAGCCSL represents Company’s Total Annual Actual Gas Commodity Costs for Swing Load
deliveries to Company’s city gate and is equal to the total monthly actual gas commodity costs.
To the extent that TAAGCCSL exceeds TABGCCSL for the PBR period, then the GAIFSL Shared
Expenses shall be computed as follows:
GAIFSL Shared Expenses = TAAGCCSL - TABGCCSL
To the extent that TAAGCCSL is less than TABGCCSL for the PBR period, then the GAIFSL

1. Applicable
Applicable to Rate G-1 Sales Service, residential and commercial classes only.
The Distribution Charge under Residential and Commercial Rate G-1 Sales Service, shall be increased or
decreased beginning each January and continuing through December 31 of each year by the DSM Cost (T)
Recovery Component (DSMRC) at a rate per Mcf in accordance with the following formula:
DSMRC = DCRC + DLSA + DIA +DBA
Where:
DCRC = DSM Cost Recovery-Current. The DCRC shall include all actual costs, direct and indirect,
under this program which has been approved by the Commission. This includes all direct
costs associated with the program including rebates paid under the program, the cost of
educational supplies, and customer awareness related to conservation/efficiency. In
addition, indirect costs shall include the costs of planning, developing, implementing,
monitoring, and evaluating DSM programs. In addition, all costs incurred by or on behalf of
the program, including but not limited to costs for consultants, and administrative expenses,
will be recovered through the DCRC.
DLSA = DSM Lost Sales Adjustment. To effectively promote and execute the program, the Company
shall recover the annual lost sales attributable to customer conservation/efficiency created as
a result of the Program. This aligns the Company’s interest with that of its customers by
reducing the correlation between volume and revenue for those customers who elect to
participate in the program. The lost sales are the estimated conservation, per participant,
times the base rate for the applicable customer. The goal is to make the Company whole for
promoting the program. Lost sales are based on the cumulative lost sales since the program
inception and will reset when the Company completes a general rate case.

DIA = DSM Incentive Adjustment. As a result of the program, the customers who participate in
the program will save on their gas bills due to decreased usage, which results in decreased
commodity charges. As an incentive for the Company to devote the necessary monetary and
physical resources to promote and administer the program, the Company will earn a fifteen
percent (15%) incentive based on the net resource savings of the Program participants.
Net resource savings are defined as Program benefits less utility Program costs and
participant costs where Program benefits will be calculated on the basis of the present value
of Atmos’ avoided commodity costs over the expected life of the Program. For the purpose
of calculating the Program benefits, a specific measure’s life as defined in DEER (Database
for Energy Efficient Resources), EnergyStar or NEEP is assumed with future gas costs over
a corresponding period based on projection of the Company’s Gas Cost Adjustment (GCA)
at the time of filing with escalation factors determined by NYMEX futures prices on the cost
of gas at Henry Hub. The present value is the weighted average cost of capital as stated in
the Company’s most recent rate case.
DBA = DSM Balance Adjustment. The DBA shall be calculated on a calendar year basis and be
used to reconcile the difference between the amount of revenues actually billed through the
DSMRC and the revenues which should have been billed.
The DBA for the upcoming twelve-month period shall be calculated as the sum of the
balance adjustments for the DCRC, DLSA and DIA. For the DCRC, DLSA and DIA, the
balance adjustment shall be the difference between the amount billed in a twelve-month
period and the actual cost of the DSM Program during the same twelve-month period.
The balance adjustment amounts calculated will include interest to be calculated at a rate
equal to the average of “3-month Commercial Paper Rate” for the immediately preceding
twelve-month period.
The Company will file modifications to the DSMRC on an annual basis at least two months prior to the
beginning of the effective upcoming twelve-month period for billing. This annual filing shall include
detailed calculations of the DCRC, DLSA, DIA and the DBA, as well as data on the total cost of the DSM
Program over the twelve-month period. The calculations plus interest shall be divided by the expected Mcf
sales for the upcoming twelve-month period to determine the DSMRC.

5. Alternative Fuel Responsive Flex Provision (T)
Notwithstanding any other provision of this tariff, the Company may, periodically, flex the applicable
Distribution Charge on a customer specific basis if, a customer presents sufficient reliable and persuasive
information to satisfactorily prove to the Company that alternative fuel, usable by the customer’s facility,
is readily available, in both advantageous price and adequate quantity, to completely or materially displace
the gas service that would otherwise be facilitated by this tariff. The customer shall submit the appropriate
information by affidavit on a form on file with the Commission and provided by the Company. The
Company may require additional information to evaluate the merit of the flex request.
Pursuant to this Section, the Company may flex the otherwise applicable transportation rate to allow the
delivered cost of gas to approximate the customer’s total cost, including handling and storage charges, of
available alternative fuel. The minimum flexed rate shall be the non-commodity component of the
customer’s otherwise applicable rate.
The Company will not flex for volumes which, if delivered, would exceed either (1) the current operable
alternative fuel fired capability of the customer’s facilities, or (2) the energy equivalent of the quantity of
alternative fuel available to the customer, whichever is less. The Company reserves the right to confirm,
to its satisfaction, the customer’s alternative fuel capability and the reasonableness of the represented
price and quantity of available alternative fuel.

10. Late Payment Charge
A late payment charge may be assessed if a customer fails to pay a bill for services by the due date shown
on the customer’s bill. The charge may be assessed only once on any bill for rendered services. Any
payment received shall first be applied to the bill for service rendered. Additional charges shall not be
assessed on the unpaid late payment charge.
11. Alternative Fuel Responsive Flex Provision
Notwithstanding any other provision of this tariff, the Company may, periodically, flex the applicable
Distribution Charge on a customer specific basis if, a customer presents sufficient reliable and persuasive
information to satisfactorily prove to the Company that alternative fuel, usable by the customer’s facility,
is readily available, in both advantageous price and adequate quantity, to completely or materially displace
the gas service that would otherwise be facilitated by this tariff. The customer shall submit the appropriate
information by affidavit on a form on file with the Commission and provided by the Company. The
Company may require additional information to evaluate the merit of the flex request.
Pursuant to this Section, the Company may flex the otherwise applicable transportation rate to allow the
delivered cost of gas to approximate the customer’s total cost, including handling and storage charges, of
available alternative fuel. The minimum flexed rate shall be the non-commodity component of the
customer’s otherwise applicable rate.
The Company will not flex for volumes which, if delivered, would exceed either (1) the current operable
alternative fuel fired capability of the customer’s facilities, or (2) the energy equivalent of the quantity of
alternative fuel available to the customer, whichever is less. The Company reserves the right to confirm,
to its satisfaction, the customer’s alternative fuel capability and the reasonableness of the represented price
and quantity of available alternative fuel.

or if a customer has been incorrectly billed for any other reason, except in an instance where the
Company has filed a verified complaint with the appropriate law enforcement agency alleging fraud
or theft by a customer, the Company will immediately determine the period during which the error
has existed and will recompute and adjust the customer’s bill. The adjustment will provide either a
refund to the customer or collect an additional amount of revenue from the underbilled customer.
The Company will readjust the account based upon the period during which the error is known to

precision, the time period will be estimated using such data as elapsed time since the last meter test,
if applicable, and historical usage data for the customer. If that data is not available, the average
usage of similar customer loads shall be used for comparison purposes in calculating the time
period. If the customer and the Company are unable to agree on an estimate of the time period

customer overbilling the customer’s account will be credited or the overbilled amount refunded at
the discretion of the customer within thirty (30) days after the final meter test results. The Company
will not require customer repayment of any underbilling to be made over a period shorter than a

c) The Company will monitor customers’ usage at least quarterly by comparing the volume against a (T)

which extend for a period longer than thirty (30) days shall be in writing and will advise customers that service
may be terminated without additional notice if the customer fails to meet the obligations of the plan.
b) The Company has a budget plan available for the convenience of its customers. The plan is designed to help
equalize payment for gas service over a period of twelve months. The budget payment plan amount will be
determined based on historical or estimated usage and billing amounts. Levelizing adjustments will be made as
frequently as each month. A customer may elect to enter the plan at any time during the year.
To be accepted as a budget customer, the account balance must be paid in total before the customer is put on
budget billing. It is understood that this budget billing plan will continue until the customer notifies the
Company in writing or by telephone to discontinue the plan or the customer defaults in payment of such plan.
c) For customers presenting certificates under the provision of Section 11 (c) and Section 12 of these Rules and
Regulations, the Company will negotiate partial payment plans based upon the customer’s ability to pay,
requiring the accounts to become current not later than the following October 15. Such plans may include, but

b) Upon request that service be reconnected at any premises subsequent to the initial installation or connection to
its service lines, the Company may charge the applicant a reconnect fee, as set out in the Miscellaneous Charges
Rate, Sheet No. 63.
c) The Company may "soft close" the account of any residential customer requesting service termination. Soft
close is the closing of a residential customer's account in order to cease billing without physically disconnecting
service to the premises in order to facilitate initiating service for the next residential customer at the same
premises. The Company will advise the customer that service may be left on and will instruct the customer to
lower all gas appliance thermostats. The Company will also advise the customer that if any gas appliances are to
be removed, the line servicing the required appliance must be properly plugged or capped and that a qualified
plumber should be contacted. The Company will continue to meter and read consumption at a premises under
soft close in the normal manner as provided under Section 4 of these Rules and Regulations. Neither the
customer terminating service nor the customer initiating service shall be liable for any gas metered while the
premises is under soft close. Within 30 days of service under soft close, the account shall be physically
disconnected, unless the Company enters into an agreement with a party responsible for the premises (such as a
landlord, homeowner, real estate agent, etc.) moving the account to that party's name.
10. Partial Payment and Budget Payment Plans
a) The Company will negotiate and accept reasonable partial payment plans at the request of residential customers
who have received a termination notice for failure to pay as provided in Section 11 of these Rules and
Regulations, except that the Company is not required to negotiate a partial payment plan with a customer who is
delinquent under a previous partial payment plan. Partial payment plans will be mutually agreed upon and
subject to the conditions in this subsection and Section 11 of these Rules and Regulations. Partial payment plans
which extend for a period longer than thirty (30) days shall be in writing and will advise customers that service
may be terminated without additional notice if the customer fails to meet the obligations of the plan.
b) The Company has a budget plan available for the convenience of its customers. The plan is designed to help
equalize payment for gas service over a period of twelve months. The budget payment plan amount will be
determined based on historical or estimated usage and billing amounts. Levelizing adjustments will be made as
frequently as each month. A customer may elect to enter the plan at any time during the year.
To be accepted as a budget customer, the account balance must be paid in total before the customer is put on

c) For customers presenting certificates under the provision of Section 11 (c) and Section 12 of these Rules and
Regulations, the Company will negotiate partial payment plans based upon the customer’s ability to pay,
requiring the accounts to become current not later than the following October 15. Such plans may include, but
